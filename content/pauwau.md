# Annual Pauwau Celebration

The Waccamaw Indian People host our annual Pauwau during the **first week of November** each year, celebrating our living culture and welcoming visitors to experience authentic indigenous traditions in the heart of South Carolina's Lowcountry.

## What is a Pauwau?

A Pauwau (also commonly spelled "powwow") is a vibrant gathering that celebrates Native American culture through traditional dancing, drumming, storytelling, and community fellowship. Our annual event showcases the rich heritage of the Waccamaw people while honoring intertribal connections and welcoming all who wish to learn about and respect indigenous traditions.
