## Design Concept
A detailed, modern iconographic logo featuring:
- **Red Hawk Portrait**: Highly detailed side profile with dimensional features showing the hawk looking slightly forward into the foreground

## Art Style: Detailed Illustrative
The logo uses a sophisticated, naturalistic design:
- **High detail**: Complex path work capturing realistic feather patterns and facial features
- **Dimensional rendering**: Three-dimensional perspective showing depth and form
- **Dual-tone shading**: Primary and secondary blues create natural shadows and highlights
- **Downward gaze**: Hawk looking slightly down and forward, creating engagement with viewer
- **Organic forms**: Natural curves and flowing lines reflecting the hawk's anatomy
- **Professional quality**: Suitable for both digital and high-resolution print applications

## SVG Structure
The logo is built with detail and scalability in mind:
- Complex path-based illustration with multiple feather and facial detail layers
- Organized with logical grouping (background, circular band, hawk body, wing details)
- Dual-tone color palette (primary dark blue, secondary darker blue for depth)
- ViewBox set to 2048x2048 for high-resolution rendering
- Generated with AI assistance for natural, organic forms

## Usage
The SVG can be used at any size without quality loss, suitable for:
- Website favicons and icons
- Social media profile images (works well at small sizes)
- App icons and branding
- Print materials (letterhead, business cards)
- Embroidery and physical products

## Customization Notes

### Adjusting Colors
The logo uses inline fill colors throughout:
- `rgb(0, 67, 132)` - Primary dark blue for main hawk body, circular band, and eye details
- `rgb(0, 45, 90)` - Secondary darker blue for shadowing and depth on wing feathers
- `rgb(244, 244, 244)` - Light background and highlight areas on feathers

To change colors, replace the RGB values in the SVG path fill attributes. The dual-tone approach creates natural depth.

### Scaling
- The `viewBox="0 0 400 400"` ensures the logo scales proportionally
- Change `width` and `height` attributes as needed
- Use in HTML: `<img src="logo.svg" width="100%">` for responsive scaling
- Works perfectly as a favicon at 16x16 or 32x32 pixels

### Symbol Modifications
- **Red Hawk Portrait**: Complex multi-path illustration with detailed feathering, facial features, and dimensional perspective
- **Circular Band**: Single thick ring framing the hawk, representing unity and the sacred circle
- **Feather Details**: Individual wing feathers rendered with natural flow and organic curves
- **Three-Dimensional Face**: Hawk head showing subtle perspective with eye, beak, and facial contours
- **Downward Gaze**: Head tilted to look down and slightly forward into the foreground

Note: This is a complex illustration generated with AI assistance. Major modifications may require regeneration.

## Design Philosophy
This logo embraces **detailed illustrative realism**:
- High-detail iconographic design honoring the red hawk as a powerful symbol
- Red hawk (not eagle) representing vision, awareness, and connection to the natural world
- Three-dimensional rendering creates depth and engagement with viewers
- Complex feather work and natural forms reflect authentic representation
- Circular band represents unity, continuity, and the sacred circle
- Dual-tone color palette creates natural depth without gradients
- No text allows for universal recognition and flexible pairing with wordmarks
- Vector format scales from small icons to large prints while maintaining detail
