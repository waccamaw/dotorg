## ℹ️ Note: Consider Using Micro.blog Interface

**For simple blog posts, photos, and news updates**, you can post directly via Micro.blog's web interface without using GitHub!

👉 **See:** [`.github/MICROBLOG_POSTING_GUIDE.md`](.github/MICROBLOG_POSTING_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**Use this GitHub issue template only for:**
- Structural content changes (modifying permanent pages like About, Meetings info)
- Content that requires specific formatting or technical features
- Bulk content updates
- When you're comfortable with GitHub and want to use version control
