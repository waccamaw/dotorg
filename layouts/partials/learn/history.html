  <h2>THE HISTORY OF THE WACCAMAW</h2>
  <p>
    The Waccamaw Indian People of Conway, South Carolina, are the descendants of a group of people who lived and farmed in the area of South Carolina now known as Dog Bluff. Although the inhabitants of the Dimery settlement conducted business and existed as a separate community throughout the years, it wasn't until 1992 that a formal organization was formed to protect the history and traditions of our people.

    The tribe was chartered as a non-profit organization in October of 1992, with the initial organizational meeting held on October 17, 1992. At this meeting, the original founders relinquished all control to the tribal council. The word "Chicora" was added in January 1993 by a majority vote of the governing council. This addition was intended to define the area of our people and to establish the boundaries of the Waccamaw. In January of 2002, the tribal community voted to eliminate the term "Chicora" from its name in order to avoid confusion with another group in the area using the word to denote their people.
